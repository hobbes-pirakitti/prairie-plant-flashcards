This is my flashcards app. There are many flashcard apps, but this one is mine.

Prairie Plant Flashcards is a personal learning project.  It is a monorepo with React (Vite) as the frontend and an Express backend.

The frontend features prairie plant images (with filterable groupings) and basic facts to memorize about them:  Common name, family, genus, species, and bloom time.  Keyboard navigation is available on desktop.  There is mobile-friendly styling as well.
The backend is for now a mocked read-only database.
